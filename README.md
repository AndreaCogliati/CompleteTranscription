# CompleteTranscription
Code for the paper "Transcribing Human Piano Performances into Music Notation" accepted at ISMIR 2016

The code requires the Python module music21 (http://web.mit.edu/music21/)

It also requires a working installation of Lilypond (http://lilypond.org), the Melisma Music Analyzer, Version 2.0 (http://davidtemperley.com/melisma-v2/) and the programs "harmony", "key", and "mftext-release-07" from Melisma Version 1.0 (http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/music-analysis/melisma2003/). All the programs must be on the system path.

To test your installation, run the Python script CompleteTranscription.py, a PDF file with the transcription of minuet.mid should be generated.
